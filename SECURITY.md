# Security Policy

## Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

We use GitHub's private vulnerability reporting feature to handle security issues. To report a security vulnerability:

1. Navigate to the [ttsim repository](https://github.com/tenstorrent/ttsim)
2. Click on the **Security** tab
3. Click **Report a vulnerability** to open the advisory form
4. Fill out the form with details about the vulnerability

Alternatively, you can go directly to: https://github.com/tenstorrent/ttsim/security/advisories/new

Please include the following information in your report:

* Type of issue (e.g., buffer overflow, memory corruption, etc.)
* Full paths of source file(s) related to the manifestation of the issue
* The location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
* Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue
* Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
* Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
* Impact of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit the issue

This information will help us triage your report more quickly.

## Response Process

After you submit a report, the security team will:

1. Acknowledge receipt of your vulnerability report
2. Assess the vulnerability and determine its impact
3. Work on a fix for the issue
4. Keep you informed of our progress through the private advisory

We aim to respond to security reports within 5 business days with an assessment and plan.

## Disclosure Policy

We follow a coordinated disclosure policy. We will work with you to understand the scope
of the vulnerability and develop a fix before any public disclosure. We appreciate your
patience and cooperation in keeping our users safe.

## Supported Versions

Security updates will be provided for the most recent release of ttsim. We encourage all
users to keep their installations up to date.

## Comments on this Policy

If you have suggestions on how this process could be improved, please open an issue
or send an email to [opensource@tenstorrent.com](mailto:opensource@tenstorrent.com).
