# Contributing to ttsim
Thank you for your interest in contributing to the `ttsim` simulator project!

## Current Status
We currently provide binary releases only, with plans to release source code in the future under the Apache License.

## Code of Conduct
This project adheres to the Contributor Covenant [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By participating, you are expected to uphold this code. Please report unacceptable behavior to [opensource@tenstorrent.com](mailto:opensource@tenstorrent.com).

## Security Issues
If you discover a security vulnerability, please do **not** report it through public GitHub issues. Instead, please follow our [Security Policy](SECURITY.md) and report it privately through GitHub's security advisory feature.

## How to Contribute

### Reporting Issues
We welcome and encourage community feedback through GitHub issues. Please use issues to:
- Report bugs
- Request features
- Ask questions
- Provide feedback

When filing an issue, please include:
- Clear description of the problem or request
- Steps to reproduce (for bugs)
- Expected vs actual behavior
- System information and `ttsim` version

Before filing a new issue, please search existing issues to see if your topic has already been discussed. This
helps keep our issue tracker organized and prevents duplicate reports.

### Pull Requests
We do not accept pull requests for this project. This policy will remain in place even after source code is released, as the public source will be a filtered version of our internal repository that doesn't support the standard PR workflow.

For any code-related suggestions or contributions, please file an issue instead where we can discuss the best approach.

## Questions?
Feel free to [open an issue](https://github.com/tenstorrent/ttsim/issues) if you have any questions about contributing or using `ttsim`.
